# Reproducible-Research
This forkedrepo contains my project work 1 for “Reproducible Research” course with the following files for submission:

    * PA1_template.Rmd - My report with text and R code chunks needed to reproduce the results to the follwing questions:
      1.	Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
      2.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
      3.	Mean and median number of steps taken each day
      4.	Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
      5.	The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
      6.	Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
      7.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
      8.	Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
